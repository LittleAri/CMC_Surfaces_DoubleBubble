# Constant Mean Curvature Surfaces and the Double Bubble Theorem

## Area-Minimizing, Volume-Preserving Surfaces

If we consider a bundle of surfaces, all with equal volume, the following question arises:

*Which surface has the least surface-area given a certain volume?*

If we're talking about one volume, then the answer is a sphere. This can be shown using the **Alexandrov Theorem** and the **Isoperimetric Inequality**.

In this project, we offer proofs for these theorems.

## Double Bubble

> The unique surface area minimizing, volume-preserving 
> double bubble that contains the partitioned volumes V1, V2 inside the regions
> R1, R2, is the **standard double bubble**.

The oldest notable mention of the double bubble theorem was by the physicist C.V Boys in 1896.
And it wasn't until 2002 where a final proof was published. This was by Michael Hutchings, Frank Morgan, Manuel Ritore and Antonio Ros.

Here, we present ideas for the proof of the well-known Double Bubble Theorem.

## Images

All surfaces (unless they have been created by someone other than myself) were created using *matplotlib* in Python. And all other drawings were made using the drawing editpr, *Ipe*.

The code for these surfaces can be found in the repository [Geometric_Surfaces](https://github.com/LittleAri/Geometric_Surfaces)
